# 2023-Mass-Shooting-Correlations
The purpose of this analysis was to find correlations with mass shootings in 2023. The motivation behind this was an article that went viral about how there were 180 mass shootings in 2023 and we were only in the month of
April. The common correlations noted in articles seemed to be gun ownership, mental health, social isolation, ideological beliefs and domestic violence. I wanted to look into gun ownership as access to guns and the amount
of ownership seems like a likely correlation.
